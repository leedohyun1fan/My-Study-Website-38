       <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that helps you work more  efficiently by breaking your work into focused intervals. It is  useful for anyone who wants to improve their focus and productivity, especially people who struggle with staying concentrated for long periods. Making big tasks feel less overwhelming. It also encourages regular breaks, which help prevent burnout and keep the mind fresh and improve concentration. </p>

        <h3>How do you use it?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Choose a task you want to work on. Set a goal on what you want to complete within this time</li>
          <li>Set a timer for 25 minutes</li>
          <li>Work on the task without any distractions until the timer rings</li>
          <li>When the timer goes off, take a short break of about 5 minutes</li>
          <li>Repeat this cycle. Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break</li>
          <li>After completing four cycles (Pomodoros), take a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
          </ol>

        <h3>Quick Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Try to minimize distractions during each Pomodoro. Make sure your working sessions are fully focused</li>
          <li>Use breaks to relax without getting too distracted. Avoid anything too fun or engaging that might break your focus</li>
          <li>Customize the length if 25 minutes feels too long or short. However, avoid making your break time long if your study session is relatively short. </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Active Recall</h2>
          <img src="images/procrastinate.jpg" width="850" height="400" alt="girl looking at computer smiling with friends"> 
          <h3> What is it?</h3>
           <p>Active Recall is a powerful study technique where you actively try to remember information without looking at your notes or textbooks. Instead of passively rereading or highlighting notes, you challenge your memory by recalling facts, concepts, or answers on your own. This process strengthens your ability to retrieve information and improves long-term retention. This means it is especially effective for exam preparation. </p>
