      <h2>1. Pomodoro Technique</h2>
        <img src="images/clock2.jpg" width="850" height="410" alt="traditional clock in front of colourful bacgkround and notebook next to it">  
       <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that helps you work more  efficiently by breaking your work into focused intervals. It is  useful for anyone who wants to improve their focus and productivity, especially people who struggle with staying concentrated for long periods, making big tasks feel less overwhelming. It also encourages regular breaks, which help prevent burnout and keep the mind fresh and improve concentration. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h3>How do you use it?</h3>
        <ol>
  <li><strong>Choose a task:</strong> Pick a task you want to work on and set a goal for what you want to complete within this time.</li>
  <li><strong>Set a timer:</strong> Use 25 minutes or a duration that suits how long you can fully focus.</li>
  <li><strong>Work distraction-free:</strong> Focus on the task without any distractions until the timer rings.</li>
  <li><strong>Take a short break:</strong> When the timer goes off, rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat the cycle:</strong> Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.</li>
  <li><strong>Take a longer break:</strong> After completing four cycles (Pomodoros), rest for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
</ol>
          </section>

         <section> 
        <h3>Quick Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Try to minimise distractions during each Pomodoro. Make sure your working sessions are fully focused</li>
          <li>Use breaks to relax without getting too distracted. Avoid anything too fun or engaging that might break your focus</li>
          <li>Customise the length if 25 minutes feels too long or short. However, avoid making your break time long if your study session is relatively short </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Active Recall</h2>
          <img src="images/thought.jpg" width="850" height="410" alt="colourful sticky note pads shaped into thought bubbles"> 
          <h3> What is it?</h3>
           <p>Active Recall is a powerful study technique where you actively try to remember information without looking at your notes or textbooks. Instead of passively rereading or highlighting notes, you challenge your memory by recalling facts, concepts, or answers on your own. This process strengthens your ability to retrieve information and improves long-term retention. This means it is especially effective for exam preparation. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How do you use it?</h3>
         <ol>
  <li><strong>Review the topic:</strong> Start by going over the material briefly to understand the basics.</li>
  <li><strong>Recall from memory:</strong> Close your book or notes and try to remember the key concepts without looking.</li>
  <li><strong>Write or say aloud:</strong> Express everything you remember in your own words, either writing or speaking.</li>
  <li><strong>Check your notes:</strong> Compare what you recalled with your notes to find anything you missed or got wrong.</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat regularly:</strong> Practise this process consistently to reinforce your memory (combine with spaced repetition).</li>
  <li><strong>Use tools:</strong> Utilise flashcards or practice questions to actively quiz yourself.</li>
</ol>
        </section>

         <section>
          <h3>Quick Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Don't just re-read, quiz yourself</li>
            <li>Turn notes into questions. Example: Instead of “Photosynthesis = process in plants,” ask:
            “What is photosynthesis?”</li>
            <li>Keep your flashcard questions clear and specific. Example: One idea per card or question </li>
            <li> Try to recall before checking the answer. Struggling is a part of the process </li>
            <li> Track what you forget and turn them into recall questions </li>
            </ul>

          <h2>3. Spaced Repetition</h2>
          <img src="images/head.jpg" width="850" height="410" alt="white drawing of head with arrows coming out"> 
          <h3> What is it?</h3>
           <p>Spaced repetition is a powerful learning technique that helps you remember information more effectively by reviewing it at strategically spaced intervals. Instead of cramming everything at once, you revisit the material over time, each review happening just before you’re likely to forget it. This is done well with study methods like active recall by strengthening your memory and reduces the total time needed to study. It's one of the most scientifically proven methods for building long-term knowledge, especially when combined with tools like flashcards or apps such as Anki. </p>

        <section>
          <h3>How do you use it?</h3>
         
          <ol>
            <li>After learning something, write down a summary and key points in your own words</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
            <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Learn something new (eg. addition) Review and actively recall your notes at increasing intervals <b>(e.g., Day 1 → Day 3 → Day 5 → Day 7).</b></li>
            <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> Learn something new (eg. subtraction) <strong>and</strong> practice what you learned yesterday (addition)</li>
            <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> Learn a new topic or keep practicing old ones if it’s the scheduled day to review them</li>
            </ul>
            <ol start="2">
            <li><strong>If you remember something easily:</strong> Increase the interval before the next review (e.g. +3 days, then +7 days)</li>
            <li><strong>If you forget or struggle: </strong> Shorten the interval and review the material sooner (e.g., next day or same day)</li>
            <li><strong>After multiple successful recalls spaced far apar: </strong> Consider the item mastered and review less often or stop</li>
            </ol>

         <section>
          <h3>Quick Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Review material within 24 hours of first learning it</li>
            <li>Use the <b>2-3-5-7 Rule:</b> Review on Days <b>2, 3, 5, and 7 </b> after learning for each new topic</li>
           <li> When you fail to recall, shorten the interval for that item and review it sooner</li>
            <li>Keep sessions short and consistent (e.g 15-20 minutes) </li>

          <h2>4. Feynman Technique </h2>
          <img src="images/feynman.jpg" width="850" height="410" alt="girl with notebook out looking at computer watching a video of someone teaching"> 
          <h3> What is it?</h3>
           <p>The Feynman Technique is a learning method that helps you understand topics deeply by explaining them in simple terms, like you’re teaching them to someone else. This process forces you to break down complex ideas into clear, simple language, making the information easier to remember and apply. It’s especially effective for subjects that feel complicated or abstract, as it turns passive learning into active engagement.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How do you use it?</h3>
          <ol>
  <li><strong>Choose a topic:</strong> Pick something you want to learn.</li>
  <li><strong>Explain simply:</strong> Teach it out loud or in writing as if to a beginner or child.</li>
  <li><strong>Identify gaps:</strong> Notice where you struggle or get stuck in your explanation.</li>
  <li><strong>Review material:</strong> Go back to videos, textbooks, or notes to relearn weak areas.</li>
  <li><strong>Simplify and retry:</strong> Make your explanation clearer and try again.</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Keep going until you can explain confidently and clearly.</li>
</ol>

          <h2>5. Interleaving </h2>
          <img src="images/calendar.jpg" width="850" height="410" alt="Girl writing on calendar paper dated November"> 
          <h3> What is it?</h3>
           <p>Interleaving is when you mix different topics or subjects during a single session of studying, instead of doing one thing all at once. For example, you might study some maths, then science, then go back to maths. This helps your brain get better at telling topics apart and remembering them for longer. It also makes it easier to solve problems because you’re used to switching between ideas.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How do you use it?</h3>
         <ol>
  <li><strong>Switch topics:</strong> Alternate between similar but separate topics (e.g., in maths: algebra, geometry, and graphs — not maths and history).</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on confusing topics:</strong> Work on topics that can be easily mixed up to help your brain differentiate them.</li>
  <li><strong>Study in short bursts:</strong> Spend 20–30 minutes on each topic, then switch to the next.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t finish one topic completely:</strong> Move on before finishing fully and revisit it later in the session or the next day.</li>
  <li><strong>Mix practice problems:</strong> Solve different types from various chapters or skills instead of doing many of the same kind at once.</li>
  <li><strong>Use active tools:</strong> Use flashcards or practice questions to quiz yourself regularly.</li>
</ol>
        </section>

         <section>
          <h3>Quick Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Best to use when you mix topics within the same exam or standard</li>
            <li><b>Avoid</b> this studying method when you're just starting a topic. It's better to build basic understanding first before mixing subjects</li>
            <li>Use interleaving when reviewing, especially closer to exams, to help recall under pressure</li>
            <li>Start with 2-3 topics in your short sessions. Example: Don't overdo it by switching between 5 topics at once. </li>
