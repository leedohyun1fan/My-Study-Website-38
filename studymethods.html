      <h2>1. Pomodoro Technique</h2>
        <img src="images/clock2.jpg" width="850" height="410" alt="traditional clock in front of colourful bacgkround and notebook next to it">  
       <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that helps you work more  efficiently by breaking your work into focused intervals. It is  useful for anyone who wants to improve their focus and productivity, especially people who struggle with staying concentrated for long periods, making big tasks feel less overwhelming. It also encourages regular breaks, which help prevent burnout and keep the mind fresh and improve concentration. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h3>How do you use it?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Choose a task you want to work on. Set a goal on what you want to complete within this time</li>
          <li>Set a timer for 25 minutes</li>
          <li>Work on the task without any distractions until the timer rings</li>
          <li>When the timer goes off, take a short break of about 5 minutes</li>
          <li>Repeat this cycle. Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break</li>
          <li>After completing four cycles (Pomodoros), take a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
          </ol>
          </section>

         <section> 
        <h3>Quick Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Try to minimize distractions during each Pomodoro. Make sure your working sessions are fully focused</li>
          <li>Use breaks to relax without getting too distracted. Avoid anything too fun or engaging that might break your focus</li>
          <li>Customize the length if 25 minutes feels too long or short. However, avoid making your break time long if your study session is relatively short. </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Active Recall</h2>
          <img src="images/thought.jpg" width="850" height="410" alt="colourful sticky note pads shaped into thought bubbles"> 
          <h3> What is it?</h3>
           <p>Active Recall is a powerful study technique where you actively try to remember information without looking at your notes or textbooks. Instead of passively rereading or highlighting notes, you challenge your memory by recalling facts, concepts, or answers on your own. This process strengthens your ability to retrieve information and improves long-term retention. This means it is especially effective for exam preparation. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How do you use it?</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Start by reviewing the topic briefly to understand the basics</li>
            <li>Close your book or notes and try to recall the key concepts from memory</li>
            <li>Write down or say out loud everything you remember in your own words</li>
            <li>Check your notes and identify anything you missed or got wrong</li>
            <li>Repeat the process regularly to reinforce your memory (combine with spaced repetition)</li>
            <li>Use tools like flashcards or practice questions to actively quiz yourself</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

         <section>
          <h3>Quick Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Don't just re-read, quiz yourself</li>
            <li>Turn notes into questions. Example: Instead of “Photosynthesis = process in plants,” ask:
            “What is photosynthesis?”</li>
            <li>Keep your flashcard questions clear and specific. Example: One idea per card or question </li>
            <li> Try to recall before checking the answer—Struggling is a part of the process </li>
            <li> Track what you forget and turn them into recall questions </li>
            </ul>

          <h2>3. Spaced Repetition</h2>
          <img src="images/head.jpg" width="850" height="410" alt="white drawing of head with arrows coming out"> 
          <h3> What is it?</h3>
           <p>Spaced repetition is a powerful learning technique that helps you remember information more effectively by reviewing it at strategically spaced intervals. Instead of cramming everything at once, you revisit the material over time, each review happening just before you’re likely to forget it. This is done well with study methods like active recall by strengthening your memory and reduces the total time needed to study. It's one of the most scientifically proven methods for building long-term knowledge, especially when combined with tools like flashcards or apps such as Anki. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How do you use it?</h3>
         
          <ol>
            <li>After learning something, write down a summary and key points in your own words</li>
            <li>Day 1: Learn something new (eg. addition).</li>
            <li>Review and actively recall your notes at increasing intervals (e.g., Day 1 → Day 3 → Day 5 → Day 7).</li>
            <li>Day 2: Learn something new (eg. subtraction) <strong>and</strong> practice what you learned yesterday (addition)</li>
            <li>Schedule your reviews, and on each review try to recall the answer before checking it</li>
            <li>Day 3: Learn a new topic or keep practicing old ones if it’s the scheduled day to review them</li>
            <li>If you remember something easily, increase the interval before the next review (e.g., +3 days, then +7 days)</li>
            <li>If you forget or struggle, shorten the interval and review the material sooner (e.g., next day or same day)</li>
            <li>After multiple successful recalls spaced far apart, consider the item mastered and review less often or stop</li>
          </ol>
          
        </section>

         <section>
          <h3>Quick Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Review material within 24 hours of first learning it</li>
            <li>Use the 2-3-5-7 Rule: Review on Days 2, 3, 5, and 7 after learning for each new topic</li>
           <li> When you fail to recall, shorten the interval for that item and review it sooner</li>
            <li>Keep sessions short and consistent (e.g 15-20 minutes) </li>
            </ul>

          <h2>5. Interleaving </h2>
          <img src="images/calendar.jpg" width="850" height="410" alt="Girl writing on calendar paper dated November"> 
          <h3> What is it?</h3>
           <p>Interleaving is when you mix different topics or subjects during a single session of studying, instead of doing one thing all at once. For example, you might study some maths, then science, then go back to maths. This helps your brain get better at telling topics apart and remembering them for longer. It also makes it easier to solve problems because you’re used to switching between ideas.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>How do you use it?</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Switch between similar but separate topics (e.g. in maths: algebra, geometry, and graphs -> not maths and history).</li>
            <li>Focus on topics that can be easily confused, so your brain works to tell them apart</li>
            <li>Study each topic for short periods (e.g. 20–30 minutes), then rotate to the next</li>
            <li>Don’t fully finish one topic before moving on -> revisit it later in the same session or next day</li>
            <li>Mix practice problems from different chapters or skills instead of doing all of one type at once</li>
            <li>Use tools like flashcards or practice questions to actively quiz yourself</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

         <section>
          <h3>Quick Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Best to use when you mix topics within the same exam or standard</li>
            <li><b>Avoid</b> this studying method when you're just starting a topic. It's better to build basic understanding first before mixing subjects</li>
            <li>Use interleaving when reviewing, especially closer to exams, to help recall under pressure</li>
            <li>Start with 2-3 topics in your short sessions. Example: Don't overdo it by switching between 5 topics at once. </li>
