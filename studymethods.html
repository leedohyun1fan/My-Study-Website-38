      <h2>1. Pomodoro Technique</h2>
       <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that helps you work more  efficiently by breaking your work into focused intervals. It is  useful for anyone who wants to improve their focus and productivity, especially people who struggle with staying concentrated for long periods. Making big tasks feel less overwhelming. It also encourages regular breaks, which help prevent burnout and keep the mind fresh and improve concentration. </p>
