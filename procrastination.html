       <h3>📈 Eisenhower Box: Study Prioritisation</h3>
       
        <p><b>What is it?</b></p>
        
         <p>A time management tool that helps you decide what tasks to focus on, delegate, or drop  based on how urgent and important they are.
         It's especially useful for managing schoolwork, revision, and personal tasks.</p>
         

  <p><b>How to Use It:</b></p>
  <p>Draw a grid with four boxes, each representing a category:</p>


    <p><strong>🟥 Urgent & Important</strong><br>
    → Do these tasks right away.<br>
    <span>Examples: An assignment due tomorrow, last-minute revision for a test tomorrow.</span></p>



    <p><strong>🟨 Not Urgent but Important</strong><br>
    → Schedule these tasks and make time for them.<br>
    → This is the most important quadrant for building long-term study habits.<br>
    <span>Examples: Long-term studying, reviewing past papers, developing understanding — these support long-term success but aren’t immediately due.</span><br>
    </p>



    <p><strong>🟦 Urgent but Not Important</strong><br>
    → Try to delegate or limit time spent here.<br>
    <span>Examples: Answering texts during study, helping someone last-minute with their homework when yours is due soon.</span></p>


    <p><strong>⬛️ Not Urgent & Not Important</strong><br>
    → Avoid these until all priorities are done. These are distractions.<br>
    <span>Examples: Scrolling through social media, binge-watching shows during study time.</span></p>
  

   <p><b>Why it works:</b></p>
   <p>This helps you avoid spending all your time reacting to "urgent" things and instead focus on what's actually important for your goals. This sets structure for you, lessening the urge to procrastinate where you often have no idea what to do first.
