          <h2>The Vision</h2>  
          <p>My goal is to support New Zealand teens, especially senior high school students, with the stress that comes from studying and 
            academic pressure. I know how overwhelming it can be to search across multiple platforms for effective resources or 
            techniques, so this website is designed to bring them all into one place. It’s not just about improving grades, 
            but also about promoting well-being and helping students build healthier, more confident study habits.</p>

          <h2>What we offer</h2>
          <p>You’ll find clear study strategies, time management tools, and useful NCEA-specific resources. 
            Everything is designed to be practical, easy to understand, and focused on helping you take action. 
            This is a space for students who want to be more productive without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

          <h2>Who I am</h2>
          <p>I’m a New Zealand high school student who knows what it feels like to be stressed, unmotivated, or unsure about how to study. 
            I created this site because I wanted something that could actually help with those struggles. This is a project I’m passionate 
            about because it’s based on real experiences and made for students like me who want to do well but need the right support.</p>

           <h2>Get in touch</h2>
           <p>If you have feedback, questions, or helpful suggestions, I’d love to hear from you. Whether you're a student, teacher, or just someone who wants to support this project, feel free to reach out.
             This is a growing space, and your input is always welcome.</p>
